Co-working space in Cite Soleil - questions and answers
=======================================================

<b> Idea </b>

The idea is:
- rent small building in Cite Soleil
- install solar panels, small wind turbines on the roof and connect batteries creating small electrical network
- create few offices in the building where office equipment is fed by local electricity net
- setup satellite or some other internet connection

This is co-working space (CWS)! It can be set with relatively small expenses in Cite Soleil.

<b>Q: Suppose it is done. Now what? </b>

Now the manager of the CWS will select promising candidates to start looking for work via internet.

<b>Q: How to find candidates with neccessary skills? </b>

In the case of Cite Soleil it will be neccessary to use co-working space as trainging center. E.g. 
run few clases on JS programming using online tutors and/or offline materials - books.

<b> Q: But how to select candidates? Where to find them with suitable initial background? </b>
